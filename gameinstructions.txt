PARACHUTING COWS!
Aliens have abducted your Bovine Best Friends (BBFs) and are dropping them from spaceships at increasing speed to 'meat' their 'udder' doom on the spikes below. 

Luckily, the cows have parachutes to slow their fall. Lock onto a cow and send them a jetpack to 'mooove' them safely home.
